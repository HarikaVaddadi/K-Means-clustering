# K-Means clustering on IRIS Dataset

The main goal is to analyse the data and build a K-means clustering model to cluster the data into groups. In this repo k-means clustering algorithm is implemented on IRIS dataset in Python.

In K Means clustering algorithm the outcome variable is not used in the training process. Here we have assumed we do not have the target column to form clusters while training the model and then used it to check our model performance.
In this case, we import the sample IRIS dataset and we convert the dataset to a Pandas Dataframe. 
We will visualize the data through scatter plots. 
Finally, after training the model we compare our original data with predicted clustered results. 

# Dependencies
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Sklearn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

# Result
The model works with 89% accuracy.
